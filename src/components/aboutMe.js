          I am a self-taught Front-End Developer. I have a master's degree in
          Electrotechnical and Computers Engineering and I had my first job
          while I was studying as a Support Specialist. This is where I
          developed and improved a variety of technical skills such as&nbsp;
          <Skill>SQL</Skill>,&nbsp; <Skill>JavaScript</Skill>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
          <Skill>C#</Skill>. I am used to working in fast-paced production
          environments and work effectively under pressure.

          After nearly 3 years of working at SOFYNE, where I became a Shift
          Leader, I decided that it was time for me to pursue a career that I
          was really passionate about; to focus on deepening my knowledge in
          Front-End development. My goal is to create software that is not only
          functional and intuitive but also is able to stand out in today's
          competitive market. I am always looking for new opportunities. I love
          to learn new things every day as a way to continuously improve myself.
