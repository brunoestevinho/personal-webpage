        I have a master degree in Eletrotecnical and Computers Engineering and
        had my first job before finishing my studies as a Support Specialist.
        While I developed and improved many technical skills such as SQL,
        JavaScript and C# working in fast paced production environments, I've
        also managed to consolidate the ability to prioritize tasks and to work
        effectively under pressure.

        After just over 2 years, already as a Shift Leader, I decided that it
        was time for me to pursue a carrear I really enjoyed. I quit my job and
        started to deepen my knowledge in Front-End development mainly. My main
        focus is to create software that is not only functional and intuitive
        but also able to stand out. I love to learn new things everyday as a way
        to continuous improve and to exceed myself.
