          I have a master degree in Eletrotecnical and Computers Engineering and
          had my first job before finishing my studies as a Support Specialist.
          While I developed and improved many technical skills such as SQL,
          JavaScript and C# working in fast paced production environments, I've
          also managed to consolidate the ability to prioritize tasks and to
          work effectively under pressure.

          After just over 2 years, already as a Shift Leader, I decided that it
          was time for me to pursue a carrear I really enjoyed. I quit my job
          and started to deepen my knowledge in Front-End development mainly. My
          main focus is to create software that is not only functional and
          intuitive but also able to stand out. I love to learn new things
          everyday as a way to continuous improve and to exceed myself.
