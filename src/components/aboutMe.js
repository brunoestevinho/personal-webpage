        I'm from Portugal and i have concluded my master degree in
        Eletrotecnical and Computers Engineering. I had my first job before
        finishing my studies as a Support Specialist. I stayed for more than 2
        years when, already as a Shift Leader, I decided that it was time for me
        to pursue a carrear I really enjoyed. I quit my job and started to
        deepen my knowledge in Front-End development.
